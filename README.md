# Photo-Caption-Generator
Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.  It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on examples of this problem.  Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on caption generation problems. What is most impressive about these methods is a single end-to-end model can be defined to predict a caption, given a photo, instead of requiring sophisticated data preparation or a pipeline of specifically designed models.  In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a photo captioning deep learning model from scratch.  After completing this tutorial, you will know:  How to prepare photo and text data for training a deep learning model. How to design and train a deep learning caption generation model. How to evaluate a train caption generation model and use it to caption entirely new photographs.
